## Description
An MVC content management system for a playlist creator written in Express.js and Node.js. It utilizes asynchronous JavaScript functions and performs CRUD functions (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on playlists. Users can view their own playlists as well as all songs, artists, genres, and playlists. The app uses the `MySQL2`, `Express`, `dotenv`, and `Sequelize` Node.js packages.

### User Story

```
AS a user
I WANT to view a list of artists
WHEN I click the artist name, their song, albums, and genre will populate on the page
THEN if the user is signed in, they will be able to add the song to their playlist
```
